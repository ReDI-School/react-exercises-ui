        <span role="img" aria-label="bulb">
          ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

      We're trying to create a dynamic input text component, by passing
      different properties to it each time:
      <div>A default value</div>
      <div>
        A placeholder (that is, the text we display when the input is blank)
      </div>
      <div>
        <span role="img" aria-label="bulb">
          ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

        Let's talk about checkboxes!
        <br />
        As part of our sign up form, we'd like to display, at the bottom, a
        couple of ticks to confirm whether the user:
        <div>1) Accepts the terms and conditions.</div>
        <div>2) Accepts to receive a monthly newsletter.</div>
        <div>
          We'd like to customise the default values for these checkbox on each
          case.

        As part of our new diet, our nutritionist has suggested us to eat more
        fruit, unsurprisingly. She's particularly interested on apples and
        oranges.
        <br />
        Let's display a dropdown to pick a piece of fruit, with the ability of
        showing a different default element each time.
